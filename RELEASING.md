# Releasing mvx

This document describes the process for creating a new release of mvx.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a release, ensure you have:

1. **Git repository access**: Push access to the main repository
2. **Clean working directory**: No uncommitted changes
3. **All tests passing**: Run `./mvx test` to verify
4. **Updated documentation**: Ensure all changes are documented
5. **Version decision**: Decide on the version number following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## Version Numbering

mvx follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version (e.g., `v1.0.0` ‚Üí `v2.0.0`): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** version (e.g., `v1.0.0` ‚Üí `v1.1.0`): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** version (e.g., `v1.0.0` ‚Üí `v1.0.1`): Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Release Process

### 1. Prepare the Release

```bash
# Ensure you're on the main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify the working directory is clean
git status

# Run tests to ensure everything works
./mvx test

# Optional: Preview the changelog for the upcoming release
./mvx changelog  # Shows changes since last tag
```

### 2. Create the Release

Use the release script to automate the process:

```bash
# Create a new release (replace with your version)
./scripts/release.sh v1.2.3
```

The release script will:
1. ‚úÖ Validate the version format
2. ‚úÖ Check that the tag doesn't already exist
3. ‚úÖ Run tests to ensure everything works
4. ‚úÖ Build binaries for all platforms
5. ‚úÖ Generate checksums
6. ‚úÖ Create and push the git tag
7. ‚úÖ Trigger GitHub Actions to create the release

### 3. Monitor the Release

After running the release script:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Visit [Actions tab](https://github.com/gnodet/mvx/actions) to monitor the release workflow
2. **Verify the release**: Once complete, check the [Releases page](https://github.com/gnodet/mvx/releases)
3. **Test the release**: Download and test the released binaries

## What Happens Automatically

When you push a tag, GitHub Actions automatically:

1. **Builds binaries** for all supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and architectures (amd64, arm64)
2. **Generates checksums** for all binaries
3. **Creates release notes** with:
   - Automatic changelog generated from git commits since the last release
   - Installation instructions
   - Asset table with download links
   - Checksum verification instructions
4. **Publishes the release** on GitHub

## Changelog Generation

The release process automatically generates a changelog by analyzing git commits between releases. Commits are categorized as:

- **‚ú® New Features**: `feat:` prefix or keywords like "add", "implement", "introduce"
- **üêõ Bug Fixes**: `fix:` prefix or keywords like "fix", "bug", "resolve"
- **üîß Improvements**: `refactor:`, `perf:`, `style:`, `test:` prefixes or keywords like "enhance", "improve", "optimize", "update"
- **üìö Documentation**: `docs:` prefix or keywords like "docs", "documentation", "readme", "website"
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes**: `!` in commit message or "breaking" keyword
- **üîÑ Other Changes**: Everything else

### Writing Good Commit Messages

To ensure good changelog generation, write descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples
git commit -m "feat: add Node.js tool support"
git commit -m "fix: resolve TLS timeout issues in downloads"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
git commit -m "refactor: improve Maven version resolution"

# Less ideal (but still works)
git commit -m "Add support for Node.js"
git commit -m "Fix timeout bug"
```

## Manual Changelog Generation

You can generate a changelog manually for any range:

```bash
# Between two tags
./mvx changelog v1.0.0 v1.1.0

# From a tag to current HEAD
./mvx changelog v1.0.0 HEAD

# From latest tag to HEAD (default)
./mvx changelog
```

## Testing a Release

After a release is published, test it:

```bash
# Test the wrapper installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnodet/mvx/main/install-wrapper.sh | bash
./mvx version

# Test direct binary download
curl -fsSL https://github.com/gnodet/mvx/releases/download/v1.2.3/mvx-linux-amd64 -o mvx-test
chmod +x mvx-test
./mvx-test version

# Verify checksums
curl -fsSL https://github.com/gnodet/mvx/releases/download/v1.2.3/checksums.txt
sha256sum -c checksums.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Release Script Fails

If `./scripts/release.sh` fails:

1. **Check git status**: Ensure working directory is clean
2. **Verify tests**: Run `./mvx test` manually
3. **Check version format**: Must be `vX.Y.Z` format
4. **Verify tag doesn't exist**: `git tag -l | grep v1.2.3`

### GitHub Actions Fails

If the GitHub Actions workflow fails:

1. **Check the Actions tab**: Look for error messages
2. **Common issues**:
   - Network timeouts during downloads
   - Build failures due to code issues
   - Permission issues with GitHub token

### Release Notes Are Wrong

If the generated changelog is incorrect:

1. **Check commit messages**: Ensure they follow conventions
2. **Manual edit**: Edit the release on GitHub after it's created
3. **Improve commit messages**: For future releases

## Emergency Procedures

### Delete a Bad Release

If you need to delete a release:

```bash
# Delete the tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v1.2.3
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.3

# Delete the GitHub release manually via the web interface
```

### Hotfix Release

For urgent fixes:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the release tag
2. Apply the minimal fix
3. Create a patch release (e.g., `v1.2.3` ‚Üí `v1.2.4`)
4. Follow the normal release process

## Post-Release Tasks

After a successful release:

1. **Update documentation**: If needed for the new version
2. **Announce the release**: In relevant channels/communities
3. **Update dependent projects**: If you maintain projects that use mvx
4. **Monitor for issues**: Watch for bug reports related to the new release
